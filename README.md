ML Showcase Projects contains a variety of projects to highlight different ML related skills.


Sonar Ensemble

Sonar Ensemble contains my intial framework facing ML competitions.
Out of a colletion of classical machine learning models, best evaluated models are selected to perform a hyperparameter optimization search.
The models with optimized parameters are then passed to ensemble models, like a Voting or stacking classifier.

According to mlcontests.com, this setup with additionally neural networks in the ensemble model is state of the art in classical, tabular ml competitions.



SP500 TSCV Pipeline

This project aims to introduce a ml framework to forecast the direction of the S&P500.
Input features will be processed in a time series cross validation with a moving window. A full pipeline for input transformations and with dynamic variable naming for quick comparision purposes is provided. A full backtest for training and evaluation data is supplied for further analysis.

ML Repo

ML Repo is a repository for quick view and guidance of using ml related techniques.
