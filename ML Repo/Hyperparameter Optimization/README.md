Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameter Tuning is beneficial to get the final edge in ML models. 
For unsupervised/passive Tuning i would advise to use Optuna.
For high computational/complex models i would advise to use supervised grid search with a manually defined search space and finetune with random search.
